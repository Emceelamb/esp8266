# ESP8266

Here is a collection of experiments with the ESP8266. The esp8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip that is great for many IoT projects. The chip can be incorporated on SMD projects or on a development board similar to an Arduino. The majority of these projects are made with the NodeMCU which is capable of being programmed with Arduino C/C++, Micropython, or Lua.
